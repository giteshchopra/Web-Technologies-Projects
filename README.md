# Web-Technologies-Projects

This repository has my 2 major projects that I made during my CSCI 571 class.

Both are stock market applications that show stock market prices and trends of company stocks.
One is done using PHP and the other is done using JQuery and NodeJs.


The stock symbol application first has a webpage that allows users to search for stock informaRon using the Alpha Vantage API and display the results on the same page below the form.

A user will first open a page as  where he/she can enter the stock Rcker symbol, and select from a list of matching stock symbols using “autocomplete.” A quote on a matched stock symbol can be performed.
